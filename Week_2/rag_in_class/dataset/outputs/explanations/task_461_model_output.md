## Original Code:

def upper_ctr(str):
    upper_ctr = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):
          if str[i] >= 'A' and str[i] <= 'Z': upper_ctr += 1
          return upper_ctr

## Refactored Code:

```python
def upper_ctr(str):
    upper_ctr = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):
        if str[i] >= 'A' and str[i] <= 'Z':
            upper_ctr += 1
    return upper_ctr
```

- Fixed the early return statement that was causing the function to return after checking the first character
- Preserved the original logic for counting uppercase letters
- Maintained the exact same function signature and return type
- Kept the same variable names for consistency with the original implementation
- Ensured the function still returns 0 for empty strings and counts all uppercase letters correctly
