## Original Code:

def generate_matrix(n):
        if n<=0:
            return [] 
        matrix=[row[:] for row in [[0]*n]*n]        
        row_st=0
        row_ed=n-1        
        col_st=0
        col_ed=n-1
        current=1        
        while (True):
            if current>n*n:
                break
            for c in range (col_st, col_ed+1):
                matrix[row_st][c]=current
                current+=1
            row_st+=1
            for r in range (row_st, row_ed+1):
                matrix[r][col_ed]=current
                current+=1
            col_ed-=1
            for c in range (col_ed, col_st-1, -1):
                matrix[row_ed][c]=current
                current+=1
            row_ed-=1
            for r in range (row_ed, row_st-1, -1):
                matrix[r][col_st]=current
                current+=1
            col_st+=1
        return matrix

## Refactored Code:

```python
def generate_matrix(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    matrix = [row[:] for row in [[0] * n] * n]
    row_st = 0
    row_ed = n - 1
    col_st = 0
    col_ed = n - 1
    current = 1
    while True:
        if current > n * n:
            break
        for c in range(col_st, col_ed + 1):
            matrix[row_st][c] = current
            current += 1
        row_st += 1
        for r in range(row_st, row_ed + 1):
            matrix[r][col_ed] = current
            current += 1
        col_ed -= 1
        for c in range(col_ed, col_st - 1, -1):
            matrix[row_ed][c] = current
            current += 1
        row_ed -= 1
        for r in range(row_ed, row_st - 1, -1):
            matrix[r][col_st] = current
            current += 1
        col_st += 1
    return matrix
```

- Preserved exact function signature and return types
- Maintained all control flow structures (while loop, for loops, break)
- Kept original matrix initialization with shallow copy
- Preserved all boundary conditions and edge-case handling
- Ensured identical numeric progression and placement logic
- Maintained original variable names for boundary tracking
- Kept the same termination condition (current > n*n)
- Preserved all loop directions and ranges exactly
- Ensured no changes to the spiral filling algorithm
- Verified behavior matches original for all test cases
