## Original Code:

def find_Max_Len_Even(str): 
    n = len(str) 
    i = 0
    currlen = 0
    maxlen = 0
    st = -1
    while (i < n): 
        if (str[i] == ' '): 
            if (currlen % 2 == 0): 
                if (maxlen < currlen): 
                    maxlen = currlen 
                    st = i - currlen 
            currlen = 0 
        else : 
            currlen += 1
        i += 1
    if (currlen % 2 == 0): 
        if (maxlen < currlen): 
            maxlen = currlen 
            st = i - currlen 
    if (st == -1): 
        return "-1" 
    return str[st: st + maxlen] 

## Refactored Code:

```python
def find_Max_Len_Even(str):
    n = len(str)
    i = 0
    currlen = 0
    maxlen = 0
    st = -1
    while i < n:
        if str[i] == ' ':
            if currlen % 2 == 0:
                if maxlen < currlen:
                    maxlen = currlen
                    st = i - currlen
            currlen = 0
        else:
            currlen += 1
        i += 1
    if currlen % 2 == 0:
        if maxlen < currlen:
            maxlen = currlen
            st = i - currlen
    if st == -1:
        return "-1"
    return str[st:st + maxlen]
```

- Preserved all function names, argument lists, and return types exactly as in the original
- Maintained the exact same logic for detecting even-length substrings separated by spaces
- Kept the original behavior of returning "-1" when no valid substring is found
- Preserved the exact same control flow and loop structure
- Maintained the original variable names and their usage patterns
- Ensured the same edge-case handling (e.g., when st remains -1)
- Kept the exact same string slicing logic for the return value
- Preserved the original behavior of checking even lengths only at space boundaries and at the end
- Maintained the exact same comparison logic for updating maxlen and st
- Ensured the function returns the same data types (string) in all cases
